flickr is online site devoted to storing, searching, sorting and sharing photographs on-line.
It is getting to be very popular and the site's willingness to inter-operate with other technologies
(such as user's own blogs) is, I'm sure, probably at least partly to blame for its popularity.
If you have a flickr account (get one at www.flickr.com - they're free) you can blog photos (along 
with a title and a description) directly into your blog from the flickr web site.

You can even specify the html you want inserted into your blog.  I've done this for my dasBlog and 
here is the formatting I use.  If you use these tags, this theme will format the pictures in a 
nice way.  You can customize the CSS for these entries to your liking if you look at 
the items.css file.

<table class="flickrTable" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" class="flickrImgCell">
      <div class="flickrImgBorder">
        <div class="flickrImg">
	  <a href="{photo_url}" title="photo sharing">
	    <img class="flickrImg" src="{photo_src_m}" alt="{photo_title}" /></a>
        </div>
	<span class="flickrCaption"><a href="{photo_url}">{photo_title}</a></span>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td valign="top" class="flickrDescCell">
      <div class="flickrDescription">
        <p>{description}</p>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
