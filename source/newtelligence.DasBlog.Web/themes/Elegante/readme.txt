This theme, by default, uses a header graphic instead of the blog's 'Title' text 
from the site.config file.  Since a blog's title doesn't change often (if ever)
I prefer this method as it allows me to customize to a much greater extent the 
look of the blog's title text.   

This header is fairly un-representative of what you will probably want on your own
blog (all it has is dasBlog on it), so you will probably want to customize your blog
with a header of your own choosing (alternatively see below).
If you wish to customize the header, you can replace Header.jpg with any header of your own 
design. The dimensions of the header are fairly important as the theme is defined
knowing exactly how large the header is.  Its dimensions are 760 x 105 pixels. I have 
also included the original photoshop template if you wish to modify it.

If you wish to have the blog's Title text displayed as text overlaid onto a header
you can do that fairly easily.  There are a group of styles in the base.css file
which may be swapped out (comment out the first group and then uncomment the 
second group) to provide this functionality.  I have even supplied a base graphic 
header (called HeaderClean.jpg) which you can replace later on if you wish to 
use this scheme but use a custom header of your own making. See base.css for 
details on which styles to comment/uncomment. Again, HeaderClean.jpg is 760 x 105 pixels.
