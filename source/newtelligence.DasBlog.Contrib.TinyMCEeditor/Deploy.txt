To install TinyMCE for dasBlog:

These instructions will use the term <dasBlog> to represent the dasBlog web folder.

1) Copy newtelligence.DasBlog.Contrib.TinyMCEeditor.dll to <dasBlog>\bin
(created by building this project - usually ends up in \source\newtelligence.DasBlog.Web\bin) 


2) Download TinyMCE from
	http://tinymce.moxiecode.com

You will need the /tinymce folder from the contents you extract

3) Deploy the tinyMCE folder (from the tinymce distribution) as a direct subfolder of <dasBlog> 
@ <dasBlog>/tinymce

4) You will need to copy the tinymce/content.css to the tinymce folder (this adds pretty editing)
@ <dasBlog/tinymce

// And perform down to END LOAD TIME IMPROVEMENT

// 4.5 is outdated
4.5) Because the native JS only solution is SLOW LOADING - You need to enable the caching script available from:
http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?groupname=tinymce&filename=tinymce_compressor_net_1_0_5.zip&use_mirror=internap

//for some reason the compression script doesn't work out of the box.
// I have updated a version on my web site until someone comes up with a reason
// why the oob version doesn't work
4.6) Instead of downloading the Out of box version from Moxy, you will need my version:

 http://www.jforsythe.com/jforsythe/proj_dasblog_addons.aspx#tabi_1


4.75) Copy only the two files:
tiny_mce_gzip.aspx
tiny_mce_gzip.js
from tinymce_compressor_net_1_0_5.zip into the folder: 
@ <dasBlog>/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/* in the <dasblog> folder.
The compression .dll in the Out of Box version .zip is the same as the one that is already included with dasBlog.




// outdated section, dont worry about it if you get my version
For some reason I am not able to get gZip working so I hardocde
	supportsGzip = false;
