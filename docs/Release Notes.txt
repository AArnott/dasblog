DasBlog 1.8.6025.3

This is a .2 release of DasBlog 1.8. Details on how to upgrade are in the readme.rtf included with the package. This is a report from SF.NET on closed items up to this release. As with all projects there are always open bugs, and this one is no different. These are the bugs that we prioritized for this release. We'll continue to look at other features and bugs and possibly include fixes/additions in feature small point releases.

The two major changes in this release are the removal of the MT-BlackList and the addition of support for using FeedBurner to serve your RSS feed.
